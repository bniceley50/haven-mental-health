# Haven Mental Health - Pricing Strategy

## Current Pricing: $49/month

### Why $49?
- **Psychological**: Under $50 feels accessible
- **Competitive**: SimplePractice is $69+, TherapyNotes is $59+
- **Sustainable**: Covers costs at 10 users, profitable at 20+
- **Simple**: No tiers, no complexity, no decision fatigue

## Pricing Philosophy

### What We're NOT Doing:
- ❌ Per-client pricing (creates wrong incentives)
- ❌ Feature tiers (creates complexity)
- ❌ Usage limits (therapists hate surprises)
- ❌ Annual only (barrier to entry)
- ❌ Hidden fees (destroys trust)

### What We ARE Doing:
- ✅ One price for everything
- ✅ Month-to-month (easy to try)
- ✅ Cancel anytime (reduces risk)
- ✅ Price lock for early users
- ✅ Transparent from day 1

## Pricing Timeline

### Phase 1: First 10 Users (Current)
**$49/month forever**
- Lock in "Founding Member" pricing
- Even if we 10x the price later
- Reward early believers

### Phase 2: Users 11-50
**$69/month**
- Still competitive
- Test price sensitivity
- More features by then

### Phase 3: Users 51-200
**$89/month**
- Market validation achieved

- Group practice features

### Phase 4: 200+ Users

- API access tier: $199/month
- Keep honoring early pricing

## Discounts & Promotions

### Always Available:
- 30-day free trial (no credit card)
- 10% off annual payment

### Never Do:
- Black Friday deals (cheapens brand)
- Coupon codes (creates bargain hunters)
- "Limited time" pressure (feels sleazy)
- Free forever plan (unsustainable)

## Objection Handling

### "It's too expensive"
**Response**: "I understand price is important. Consider that Haven replaces several tools and saves hours weekly. Most therapists find it pays for itself with just one additional client session. Would a 60-day trial help you evaluate the value?"

### "SimplePractice has more features"
**Response**: "You're right - they have tons of features. We've found most therapists use maybe 20% of them. We focus on doing the core things exceptionally well. What specific features are most important to your practice?"

### "I'll wait for a sale"
**Response**: "I appreciate your interest! We don't do sales because we believe in consistent, fair pricing. However, our early adopter pricing is $49/month locked in forever - that's already a 50% discount from our planned pricing."

### "Can I get a discount?"
**Response**: "Our first 10 users get lifetime pricing at $49 - that's the best deal we'll ever offer. After that, we keep pricing simple and fair for everyone. The value is in the time you'll save and the peace of mind."

5. **HIPAA compliance** = Avoid lawsuits

- Our tool: Price of 1 session

## Future Monetization

### Add-On Services (Year 2):

- API access: +$50/month
- White label: +$100/month
- Priority support: +$30/month

## Pricing Communication

### On Website:
"Simple pricing. No surprises.
$49/month - Everything included.
Start free for 30 days."

### In Sales:
"First 10 therapists lock in $49/month forever. You'd be number [X]."

### For Current Users:
"Your pricing is locked. Even when we raise prices for new users, you'll always pay what you signed up for."

## Key Principles

1. **Price for value, not cost**
2. **Reward early adopters forever**
3. **Keep it simple - one price**
4. **Be transparent always**
5. **Raise prices with confidence**

## Remember:

Therapists charge $100-300/hour. Our tool costs less than 30 minutes of their time per month.

Price is only an issue in the absence of value. Focus on making their practice better, and price becomes irrelevant.
