### Scripts for Common Situations:

**They're happy with current system:**
"I completely understand. Would you mind if I check back in 6 months? Things change, and I'd love to show you our progress."

**Price objection:**
"I hear you. Consider that just 2 client sessions cover the monthly cost, and the time you save on secure communication is invaluable. How about a 60-day trial?"

**Too busy to look:**
"I get it - your time is valuable. What if I send you a 2-minute video showing exactly how it would work for your practice?"

**Need more features:**
"We've intentionally kept it simple. What specific feature is most important to you? I'd love to understand your workflow better."

### Remember:
- Quality > Quantity
- No means "not yet"
- Every conversation teaches you something
- Therapists talk to each other - reputation matters
- Be helpful even if they don't buy
