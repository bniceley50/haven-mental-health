# Therapist Outreach Email Templates

## Email 1: Initial Outreach (Personal Connection)

**Subject:** Quick question about your therapy practice

Hi [Name],

I noticed you specialize in [specific therapy type] in [City]. I'm building a simple, secure messaging platform specifically for therapists like you who value client privacy.

No complex features. No billing headaches. Just encrypted messaging and video sessions.

Would you be open to a 5-minute demo this week? I'm looking for feedback from exactly 10 therapists to shape the final product.

Best,
[Your name]

P.S. First 10 therapists get lifetime pricing at $49/month (normally $99).

## Email 2: The Problem/Solution

**Subject:** Do your clients text you? (HIPAA nightmare)

Hi [Name],

Quick question - how do you handle it when clients want to text between sessions?

Most therapists I talk to either:
- Risk HIPAA violations with regular texting
- Use clunky patient portals that clients hate
- Just say "no" and lose touch between sessions

I built Haven because my therapist friend was losing sleep over this exact problem.

It's dead simple:
✓ Encrypted messaging (like Signal, but for therapy)
✓ Video sessions that actually work
✓ No insurance codes, billing, or features you won't use

Want to try it? 10-minute setup, 30-day free trial.

## Email 3: Social Proof

**Subject:** Why Dr. Sarah switched from SimplePractice

Hi [Name],

Dr. Sarah Chen told me I should reach out to you. She just switched her practice to Haven and said you might be interested.

Her exact words: "Finally, software that does what I need without 47 features I'll never use."

Haven is just:
- Secure messaging (clients love it)
- Reliable video sessions
- Quick session notes
- $49/month flat (no per-client fees)

She's saving 2 hours/week not fighting with complex software.

Worth a quick look? I can show you her setup.

## Email 4: The Honest Pitch

**Subject:** I'm building exactly what you asked for

Hi [Name],

I'll be straight with you - I'm building a therapy platform and need 10 beta users.

What it is:
- Encrypted messaging between you and clients
- Video sessions that work on any device
- Simple session notes (SOAP/DAP)
- $49/month forever if you join now

What it's NOT:
- No billing features
- No insurance claims  
- No practice management
- No features you won't use

I'm focusing on doing ONE thing perfectly: secure therapist-client communication.

Interested? Reply with "YES" and I'll send you access.
