# Daily Lessons - January 15, 2024 (Day 1)

## 📊 Today's Numbers
- Emails sent: 8
- Responses: 2
- Demos scheduled: 1
- New trials: 0
- New customers: 0
- Revenue: $0

## 🎯 What Worked
1. Personal subject lines got opened (75% open rate)
2. Mentioning "no billing features" resonated 
3. Offering specific demo times (not "when are you free?")

## 😤 What Didn't Work
1. LinkedIn messages - 0% response rate
2. Long emails - shorter ones did better
3. Sending after 5 PM - no responses

## 💡 Key Insights
1. Therapists check email mid-morning (10-11 AM best)
2. "HIPAA compliant" in subject line = instant credibility
3. Name-dropping another therapist = immediate response

## 🗣 Customer Quotes
"Finally, someone who gets that I just need messaging, not a whole EMR" - Dr. Sarah
"Can we do the demo today? I'm fed up with SimplePractice" - Mark LMFT

## 📝 Tomorrow's Focus
1. Send all emails between 10-11 AM
2. Keep emails under 100 words
3. Lead with the problem, not the solution

## 🎬 One Thing to Remember
The first yes feels impossible, then inevitable.
