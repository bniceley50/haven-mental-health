## 📊 Week 1 Totals
- Emails sent: 42
- Response rate: 28.5% (12 responses)
- Demos completed: 7
- Trials started: 4
- Customers: 2
- Revenue: $98 MRR

## 🏆 Biggest Wins
1. **First customer within 48 hours** - Momentum is everything
2. **Referral already** - Sarah referred her colleague
3. **100% demo-to-trial conversion** when I shared my screen
4. **Response rate above 25%** - Email templates are working
5. **Built confidence** - Rejection isn't personal

## 😓 Biggest Challenges
1. **LinkedIn is a ghost town** - 0% response rate, stopping this channel
2. **Time zones matter** - Missed 2 demos due to confusion
3. **Feature requests already** - Hard to say no to paying customers
4. **Energy management** - Outreach is emotionally draining
5. **CRM needed** - Spreadsheet getting messy already

## 📈 What's Working

### Email Strategy:
- **Best time**: Tuesday-Thursday, 10-11 AM
- **Best subject**: "Quick question about your therapy practice"
- **Best length**: 50-75 words
- **Best CTA**: "Are you free for a 15-min call at 2 PM?"

### Demo Strategy:
- Start with their biggest pain point
- Show messaging first (not dashboard)
- Let them try it during the demo
- End with "What would stop you from using this?"

### Follow-up Strategy:
- Same day: "Great chatting! Here's your login"
- Day 2: "Were you able to log in okay?"
- Day 5: "How was your first week?"
- Never more than 2 sentences

## 📉 What's Not Working

### Avoid:
- Features discussion (they don't care yet)
- Comparison charts (boring)
- "Revolutionary" or "innovative" language
- Group emails or automation
- Talking about the failed hospital features

### Stop Doing:
- LinkedIn outreach (0% ROI)
- Emails after 3 PM
- Long feature lists
- Apologizing for the simple design
- Checking email every 10 minutes

## 🎯 Key Insights

1. **Therapists are overwhelmed** - Simplicity is our superpower
2. **Trust is everything** - They're trusting us with PHI
3. **Speed wins** - Fast responses = professional image
4. **Stories > Features** - "Sarah saves 2 hours/week" beats any feature list
5. **Desperation smells** - Confident but not pushy works best

## 📝 Playbook Updates

### New Email Template (28% → 35% response):
```
Subject: Do your clients text you?

Hi [Name],

I noticed you specialize in [specialty] - quick question:

How do you handle when clients want to text between sessions? 

Most therapists tell me they either risk HIPAA violations or lose touch completely.

I built a simple encrypted messaging app specifically for this. Would you be interested in a 10-minute demo?

I'm free [specific time] or [specific time].

[Your name]
P.S. Currently accepting just 10 therapists at $49/month
```

### Demo Script That Converts:
1. "Before we start, what's your biggest frustration with client communication?"
2. [Listen for 2 minutes]
3. "Let me show you exactly how we solve that..."
4. [Share screen, let them drive]
5. "What questions can I answer to help you decide?"
